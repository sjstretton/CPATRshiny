#Key next steps
1. Write first draft of this document [DONE]
2. Exact match (again) the model against Excel [Next Step]
3. Once it is exact matched build this testing functionality systematically



#functions.r

This describes the key functions that the model provides. 

## Functions for Three Phases
The model is separated into three phases. 
Phase 1: Preprocessing - creates the input files.
Phase 2: Main Model - runs the model in R.
Phase 3: Graphing - creates comparison results.

Each of these phases has a function associated with it. Each phase can be run independently.

# Not doing List
- Check integrity of the source data.
